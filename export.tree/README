This experiment includes 139 subjects: 94 individuals with Parkinsons disease, 
and 45 controls. Subjects completed  this IntervalTiming task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) 
while EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task presented black instructional 
text on the center of a white screen that read "Short interval" on 3-second interval trials 
and "Long interval" on 7-second interval trials. The researchers never communicated the actual 
interval durations to the patient. The instructions were displayed for 1 second,  and the appearance 
of an image of a solid box in the center of the computer screen indicated the start of the interval. 
The cue was displayed on the screen for the entire trial, which lasted 6 s for 3-s intervals and 
14 s for 7-s intervals. The researchers instructed participants to press the keyboard spacebar 
when they judged the target interval to have elapsed. Participants were directed not to count, and 
a distractor vowel appeared at random intervals in the screen center.
